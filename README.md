# MenuTool

This is a MonoGame project written in C# with the goal of fast tracking the development of my projects by adding menus and navigation. I'm not an experienced programmer. If my code is inefficient or violates certain conventions or is just plain messy, I appologise. Contribute to the project and teach me something new! <3

ToDo: 

1. Add preset locations for menus (e.g. center, bottom left)
2. Add new types of menus. Currently, there is only a vertical stack of buttons.

   a. Inventory style menu with scroll function
3. Add navigation to previous menus
